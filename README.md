# Photo Food App

This is a simple photo feed app that uses the Flickr API.

To use the app, type in a flickr id to and click submit to see photos from that userâ€™s photostream (example id: 9619621@N02).

This is Project 2: Using a Third Party API, as described in [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/apis).
